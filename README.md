# Why I Created This Project:

This project was born out of the need to address my empty top-level domain, instead of displaying a generic error page, it now returns HTTP status code of "418 I'm a teapot."
If you're unfamiliar with the meaning of "418 I'm a teapot," you can learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol).
